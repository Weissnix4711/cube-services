[Pod]
# Immich (specifically postgres db) is fussy about who owns the data volume.
# This maps nfsuser (3000) so files don't appear as being owned by nobody:nogroup
UIDMap="+3000:@3000:1"
# If a single container has --network it loses the pod network namespace
# so we connect the entire pod to web.network instead
# TODO find a better alternative?
Network=web.network
